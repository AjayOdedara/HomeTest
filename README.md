# HomeTest
This is take home test based on user Journey Tracking.

The exercise is split into the following sections:
● Primary Goals
● Mandatory Concerns
● Bonus Goals
● Optional Goals
Primary Goals:
● These goals are listed in the order in which they should be achieved.
● Only when one goal is achieved, should you move on to the next one.
● If any goals are not achieved when the solution is submitted, please include a
written suggestion explaining how those goals would be achieved given more time.
Mandatory Concerns:
● These are concerns that MUST be addressed for any goal that is achieved.
● Failure to keep these concerns in mind when solving for a particular goal is
potentially more costly than not attempting a goal at all.
● Failure to achieve all goals but success at addressing mandatory concerns for all
goals achieved is considered better than the alternative.
Bonus Goals:
● These are goals that can be attempted when all primary goals are clear.
● Unless primary goals are attempted, bonus goals will not factor in determining
success. Otherwise, they will act as a bonus.
Optional Goals:
● These are NOT expected to be attempted by most candidates. However, you should definitely think about them and be prepared to discuss potential solutions when called in.
